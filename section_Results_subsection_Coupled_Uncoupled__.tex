\section{Results}

\subsection{Coupled / Uncoupled streamflow routing results}

Comparison to streamflow gauges: seasonal and annual runoff statistics
Comparison of land-ocean freshwater flux from other models (reanalysis, etc.), how does the distribution and timing of runoff in RASM compare to reanalysis.

\subsection{Role of high resolution coastal streamflow on ocean / sea ice}


Comparison between RB case with surface restoring to fully coupled RBR case.
Coastal ocean circulation in RB / RBR cases
Sea ice production as a function of salinity changes
Sea ice thickness distribution over decadal timescales, connections to freshwater fluxes.
