\section{Discussion}

A.	Identification of deficiencies in linear routing approach in Arctic (overbank flow, wetlands, ice jams, etc.)

B.	Need for other runoff properties such as temperature/heat flux, nutrients, and sediments.

C.	Need for thermodynamic scheme that resolves changes in freezing temperature as a function of salinity
